This is a work in progress of a revamped Air France landing page. This is the very first time I ever use the css framework Bootstrap. It takes some times to get used to not writing full css classes and it may be unsettling at first. Bootstrap is trully a gem to writing in a fast and efficient way but you can feel a little bit stuck sometimes and want to break free of it. Moreover it is not responsive yet.
